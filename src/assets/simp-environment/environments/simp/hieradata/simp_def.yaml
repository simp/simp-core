# This file contains all of the variables that need to be configured #

#                                                                    #
# Some are optional, but it is highly recommended that you have a    #
# valid value for them if at all possible.                           #
#                                                                    #
# The items that are arrays or hashes should stay in that form since #
# the SIMP code now validates option types whenever reasonable.      #

# elsewhere in Hiera.

# === LDAP Options ===
# Various LDAP-related settings. You *really* want to make sure that
# these are set since multiple modules use them.
#
# Remember that you can't include hiera arrays or hashes later on,
# only string values!
#
# If you disable this, then modules will not attempt to use LDAP where
# possible.

# for the system defaults.
#
# Individual modules can be overridden as required
#
# By default the rsync server is  127.0.0.1, with an stunnel
# connecting to the puppet server (default seen below).  If you wish
# to change the rsync server, uncomment and modify rsync_stunnel
# as needed.
