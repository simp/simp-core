# This file holds a list of RPM dependencies/obsoletes that apply
# to Puppet module RPMs.  Module entries in this file are needed when
# any of the following conditions occur:
#
# (1) We need to specify an obsoletes.
#     This is required when a project has changed owner and
#     the RPM name will change from pupmod-<old owner>-<module name>
#     to pupmod-<new owner>-<module name>.
#
# (2) We want to restrict the depedencies.
#     This is useful when modules require modules for OS's other
#     than RedHat/CentOS or require modules that conflict with SIMP
#     capabilities. We don't really need the dependencies in this
#     case, and excluding them has no impact on SIMP system
#     operations.
#
# For all modules listed in this file,
# * The RPM obsoletes will be pulled from this file.
# * The RPM dependency names will be pulled from this file.
# * The depedency versions will be pulled directly from the
#   metadata.json file in the module.
#
# For all other modules
# * The module will have no RPM obsoletes.
# * Both the RPM dependency names and versions will be pulled
#   from the metadata.json file in the module.
#
# NOTE: This file is only used for simp-rake-helpers >= 5.3.0
