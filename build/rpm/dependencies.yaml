# This file holds a list of RPM dependencies/obsoletes/releases/external
# dependencies that apply to Puppet module RPMs.  Module entries in this
# file are needed when any of the following conditions occur:
#
# (1) We need to specify a release qualifier (package version).
#     - This is necessary when a different version of the RPM spec file
#       that is generated by simp-rake-helpers for Puppet modules is
#       required. For example, we need to pick the RPM spec file
#       change that runs simp_rpm_helper in the %posttrans of the 
#       RPM instead of the %post.
#     - This is necessary when we need to specify RPM metadata-only
#       package changes, such as a change in puppet module
#       dependencies, obsoletes, or external dependencies.
#     - Example:
#         'mount_providers':
#           :release: '1'
#       
# (2) We need to specify an obsoletes.
#     - This is required when a project has changed owner and
#       the RPM name will change from pupmod-<old owner>-<module name>
#       to pupmod-<new owner>-<module name>.   
#     - Example:
#         'gitlab':
#           :obsoletes:
#             'pupmod-vshn-gitlab': '1.13.3-2016.1'
#
# (3) We want to restrict the dependencies.
#     - This is useful when modules require modules for OS's other
#       than RedHat/CentOS or require modules that conflict with SIMP
#       capabilities. We don't really need the dependencies in this
#       case, and excluding them has no impact on SIMP system
#       operations.
#     - To affect the restriction, you must specify *ALL* the
#       dependencies you want to keep. The dependencies
#       *omitted* from the list are the ones excluded.
#     - Example: The docker module has 2 Windows-compatible Puppet 
#       modules and 2 Linux-compatible modules listed as dependencies
#       in its metadata.json. We only want the Linux-compatible modules.
#         'docker':
#           :requires:
#             - 'pupmod-puppetlabs-stdlib'
#             - 'pupmod-puppetlabs-translate'
#
# (4) We want to add external dependencies, i.e., dependencies
#     that are not Puppet modules.
#     - Example:  The grafana module requires the TOML rubygem
#         'grafana':
#           :external_dependencies:
#             'rubygem-puppetserver-toml':
#              :min: '0.2.0-1'
#
# For all modules listed in this file,
# * The RPM obsoletes will be pulled from this file.
# * The RPM dependency names will be pulled from this file.
# * The depedency versions will be pulled directly from the
#   metadata.json file in the module.
#
# For all other modules
# * The module will have no RPM obsoletes.
# * Both the RPM dependency names and versions will be pulled
#   from the metadata.json file in the module.
#
# IMPORTANT ADDITIONAL NOTES:
# (1) One of the main reasons this global file exists, instead of
#     storing this information in each project, itself, is because we
#     need to build RPMs of non-SIMP components from their respective
#     GitHub projects. Maintaining this information in SIMP-owned
#     forks of non SIMP-components has shown to be untenable.
#
# (2) Any time the version of a non-SIMP component changes, you **MUST**
#     evaluate if that change results in the addition of, removal of,
#     or change to an entry in this file.
#
# (3) Each entry **MUST** remain in this file until a newer version
#     of the component is to be released.  This is because the
#     ISO-building process may create a different RPM for the same
#     version of this component, potentially with incorrect RPM
#     metadata, instead of using the existing, released RPM.
#
# (4) This file is only used for simp-rake-helpers >= 5.3.0
